# Hi, I'm Samuel England 👋

Welcome to my GitHub. I love building useful tools that solve real problems, and I am always looking for ways to grow as a developer.

## What I am working on
I am currently building a budget AI agent designed to give users smart and simple automation without expensive infrastructure. This project is helping me dive deeper into how AI agents plan, reason, and take actions across tools.

## What I am learning
Right now I am focused on improving my understanding of AI agents, vector search, and practical applications of large language models. I enjoy experimenting with agent frameworks and deploying small proof of concept systems.

## How to reach me

## About me
I enjoy data projects, backend work, and exploring creative tech ideas. My background includes programming, analytics, and building small software projects for real users.
